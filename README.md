# Run Findr
## Find your next run

Here's the brief I received 

> ## Project Overview
> A small community business has reached out to you to create a platform where they can create and share events with members of the community.
You have been tasked with building and hosting a platform (web app or progressive web app) that allows community members to view, sign up for, and add events to their own personal calendars. Staff members should have additional functionality to create and manage events.
> 
> ## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
> Your platform must fulfil the following functionality:
> 1. Display a list of events for users to browse.
> 2. Allow users to sign up for an event.
> 3. Allow users to add events to their Calendar after signing up.
> 4. Enable staff members to sign-in to create and manage events.
